# GoodOldBrowse
### A web browser meant to recover Adobe Flash
<p>GoodOldBrowse is a browser that was based on <a href="https://github.com/radubirsan/FlashBrowser">radubirsan's FlashBrowser</a>, which is not much functional and not really updated.</p>
<br>
<p>I have decided to try to fix some things <a href="https://github.com/tootyta/FlashBrowser2">the original FlashBrowser</a> and <a href="https://github.com/radubirsan/FlashBrowser">the 2nd gen FlashBrowser</a> could not fix. This is the 3rd Generation FlashBrowser, meant to finally fix all FlashBrowsers like a GoAnimate Revival, <a href="https://flashthemes.net">FlashThemes (Wrapper 2)</a>, fixed all Wrappers. So this is the goal of the project.</p>
